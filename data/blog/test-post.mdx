# What is GraphQL?

- **API standard**
- **query language** for APIs
- fetching & updating data in a **declarative** manner

## REST API vs GraphQL

- If you need different data for differen screen, you have to adjust the API over and over again.
- It's not really scalable if you want to make changes frequently.
- In REST we typically use different HTTP methods such as **POST, GET, PUT, DELETE.**
- GraphQL doesn't care about the transport layer.
- You are always sending a POST request to the server.
- The server will resolve the query for you.
- In the client side we can specify what you need

**IMPORTANT QUERY CONCEPT**
1. Queries : Only read data
2. Mutations : write and read data

## Apollo

1. **Static Type Generation**
    - At compile time, the apollo client will look at all the  queries that are being sent over to the server and it's gonna generate a corresponding Swift types for that.
    - Thus it provides security that all your data needs are always going to be fulfilled. We no longer need optional properties to prevent crashing
2. **Caching**
    - Apollo will maintain a normalized cache inside our app, so it will store all the data & we can specify policies whether you want to make request to a network or cache. This keeps the data consistent.
    - Backend â†’ Cache
3. **Query Watching**
    - Automatic UI updates inside your app  when there are data changes (i assume its like event listener?)
    - Don't need to use callbacks to update the UI manually.

## Where do I start?

**Steps**

1. pod install
2. download schema json
schema is like a contract between the client and the server, and everyone needs to adhere to that.
3. configure xcode build phase
invoke a tool that is going to look at al your graph to your queries and generate the coressponding Swift types for you.
