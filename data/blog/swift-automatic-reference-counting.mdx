## What is ARC?

Automatic Reference Counting is Swift's way to keep track of how many strong references are pointing to a specific instance. ARC is used to :
  - To track and manage memory usage;
  - so that you don't need to think about it yourself.
  - It automatically frees up memory used by class instances when they are no longer needed.
  - Only applies to instances of classes because they are reference type while enums & structs are values types and thus not stored and passed by reference.
  - Everytime an instance of a class is created/instantiated, ARC takes a chunk of memory to store information about that instance and;
  - whenever that instance is no longer needed, that memory is freed by ARC so that it can be used for other things.



## How do ARC works?

  ARC works by tracking the number of **properties, constants, and variables** that are being referred in the instance of the class.

  **How to ensure that ARC does not deallocate an instance while it is still being used?** As long as there is **one** active reference to that instance, it still exists in memory.

## Strong Reference Cycle

Is the condition when there are two instances of different class that hold a strong reference to each other, preventing each instance to be deinitialized.

### How does it happen?

```swift
class Person {
	let name: String
	var dog: Dog?

	init(name: String) { self.name = name }

	deinit { print("person named \(name) is deinitialized") }
}

class Dog {
	let name : String
	var owner: Person?

	init(name: String) { self.name = name }

	deinit { print("dog named \(name) is deinitialized") }
}
```

Let's say we have 2 class `Person` and `Dog`, now we create an instance for each class.

```swift
var adam: Person?
var max: Dog?

adam = Person(name: "Adam Smith")
max = Dog(name: "Maximus")
```

The `Person` class has an optional property of `dog` and vice versa the `Dog` class has an optional property of `owner`. Let's say we want to assign both variables to each other. We would have :

```swift
adam!.dog = max
max!.owner = adam
```

Here each of them is pointing at one another. They have strong reference to each other.

In this case, even if we were to assign `adam` as `nil`  the reference count to `max` won't drop to 0 because the `Person` class instance (that is no longer tied to the variable `adam` ) still exists somewhere in memory because the `Dog` class instance (that is no longer tied to the variable `max` ) still exists somewhere in memory referencing to back to that `Person` instance.

In short we have no way of accessing either instance but they still take up a space in the memory. This is why it is called a strong reference cycle that can't be broken.

### How to resolve it?

Fear not since the developers over at Swift have thought about it! We have 2 options to choose and they both work in a way such that an instance can refer to other instance in a **not strong** manner, thus preventing the cycle to happen.

### 1. Weak References
#### use when both properties are allowed to be nil
**Weak reference** is used when the other instance has a shorter lifetime (the other instance can be deallocated first).
It allows ARC to deallocate the referred instance once it is unused and is indicated by placing the `weak` keyword before the declaration.
When the referred instance is deallocated, ARC automatically sets the value to `nil`.

To put it into perspective, let's say that the `owner` property of the `Dog` class is `weak`.
Let's say that a dog does not necessarily always have to have an owner thus the reference to owner is weak :

```swift
class Person {
	let name: String
	var dog: Dog?

	init(name: String) { self.name = name }

	deinit { print("person named \(name) is deinitialized") }
}

class Dog {
	let name : String
	weak var owner: Person?

	init(name: String) { self.name = name }

	deinit { print("dog named \(name) is deinitialized") }
}
```

And we have the same case as before

```swift
adam!.dog = max
max!.owner = adam
```

This means that if we were to set `adam = nil` then `adam` will be deinitialized and the line `person named Adam is deinitialized` will be printed.
This is because `max` no longer holds a strong reference to adam, allowing ARC to deinitialize it.

### 2. Unowned References
#### use when only one property is allowed to be nil
**Unowned reference** is used when the other instance has the same or longer lifetime. It's usage is the same as weak reference & is indicated by placing the `unowned` keyword before the declaration.
BUT, in contrast, it is expected to **always have a value**. In other words, it is **should not be an optional**. An unowned reference to a deallocated instance may lead to runtime error.

Let's say that a person must and will always have an ID Card and therefore we write the classes like this :

```swift
class Person {
	let name: String
	var card: Card?

	init(name: String) { self.name = name }

	deinit { print("person named \(name) is deinitialized") }
}

class Card {
	let id : String
	unowned var owner: Person

	init(name: String) {
	  self.id = id
	  self.owner = owner
	}

	deinit { print("dog named \(name) is deinitialized") }
}
```

Let's create Adam & assign him an ID card.

```swift
  var adam: Person?
  adam = Person(name: "Adam Smith")
  adam.card = Card(id: "0987654321", owner: adam!)
```

Since the only strong reference here is the property `card` of the class `Person`, if we were to set `adam = nil` then both instances will be deinitialized.

**Unowned Optional References**

As we mentioned previously, an unowned reference cannot be of type optional. But, can we make it optional?
Yes it turns out we can **as long as it refers to a valid instance OR is nil**. That means if we have an unowned optional reference to an instance and that
instance is removed, then we have to ensure that all reference pointing to that instance is also removed and is set to nil.

### 3. Combination
#### use when both properties are NOT allowed to be nil
Combination of unowned property in one class and an implicitly unwrapped property on the other. Such cases where both properties are not allowed to be nil is parent-child relationship.
A parent must have a child, and a child must have a parent.

```swift
class Parent {
    let name: String
    var child: Child!
    init(name: String, childName: String) {
        self.name = name
        self.child = Child(name: childName, parent: self)
    }
}

class Child {
    let name: String
    unowned let parent: Parent
    init(name: String, parent: Parent) {
        self.name = name
        self.parent = parent
    }
}
```

Within the `Parent` class, the `child` property is of type implicitly unwrapped optional and within the `Child` class, the parent is unowned.
The `Child` initializer is called from within the `Parent` initializer. But the parent can only assign itself to the `Child` initializer after it is completely instantiated.
This is an example of a [Two-Phase Initialization](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Initialization.html#ID220). This is also why the `child` property of the parent is **implicitly unwrapped** (marked with the `!` annotation).
The `Parent` instance will have a value of `nil` for its `child` property when initialized like other optionals in general but without the need to unwrap it to access its value.
Even though the value of `child` is nil, it is still considered to be fully created or instantiated, making it able to assign `self` to the `Child` initializer.
